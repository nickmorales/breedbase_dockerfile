Files
-----
The program is provided in a universal linux version. This should be
suitable for most recent versions of Linux. It has been successfully
tested on many systems, including versions of Fedora from Fedora Core
6 and upwards, CentOS, OpenSuse, Debian and Ubuntu. The files are
contained in a compressed download as follows:

	asreml-4.x.0.b-vv.64.tgz  

where the letters 'x','b' and 'vv' are replaced by the sub-version, build
number and build letters of the software. The initial release in December 2014
was formed from asreml-4.1.0.978-lo.64.tgz, i.e. x=1,b=978 and vv="lo". Small
incremental changes to the sub-version may occur during the lifetime of this
software, principally to correct bugs that arise in use.

The tar archive contains a number of files, some of which are common to
all versions and the executable program which is specific to the target
system. The contents of the archive is as follows:

bin\asreml.sh		        shell script to invoke the program
bin\asreml-4.x.0.b-vv.64	executable image file, ASReml version 4.x, build vv
bin\RequestLicense	        a tool to generate a license request
bin\myowngdg.f90	        example Fortran source for OWN variance structure

Installation
------------
1. Create a directory to hold ASReml v4. The suggested location is:

		/opt/vsn/asreml/4.x.0.b

   which will require root privilege. Alternatively, you can install the
   software in personal file space, e.g. $HOME/asreml4

2. Copy the appropriate version of the ASReml archive file from the CD-ROM
   directory ASReml/linux, or download it from http://www.vsni.co.uk. Then
   extract the files to the directory /opt/vsn/asreml/4.x.0.b

   The following command will create the subdirectories with contents as
   listed above:

		tar xvzf asreml.4.1.0.978-lo.64.tgz

4. This step can be ignored if you have installed to /opt/vsn/asreml/4.x.0.b
   If you have installed to another location you need to edit the asreml.sh
   script to set the appropriate path name for ASREML_DIR, the ASReml
   home directory.

4. The asreml.sh script should be used to invoke the program as it sets
   up various environment variables required by ASReml. As supplied, the
   script references the current version of the program, as set by the
   variable "version". If you later add a new version of the executable
   file, simply change the setting in the script.

5. Create a symbolic link to reference the latest version using the command :

	ln -s /opt/vsn/asreml/4.x.0.b /opt/vsn/asreml/latest
 
6. To make ASReml easily available to users create a link to the file in a
    folder that is included in the default system path, e.g. in /bin:

	ln -s /opt/vsn/asreml/latest/bin/asreml.sh /bin/asreml

7. To make it easier to switch between versions of ASReml create a link to the selection script 

	ln -s /opt/vsn/asreml/latest/bin/asreml_select.sh /bin/asreml_select

You are now ready to install a license key. If you have a license key
for an earlier version of ASReml it may also be valid for later versions,
depending on whether you have maintained support on the software.

If so you can just copy the existing license file (asreml.lic) into
/opt/asreml4/bin.

If you need to renew your license, or need to activate ASReml for the
first time, you can run the RequestLicense application which is located
in the bin directory. Just type:

	/opt/vsn/asreml/latest/bin/RequestLicense

and follow the instructions that appear. You will have the choice of
online registration or saving to a file which can then be sent via
email.
